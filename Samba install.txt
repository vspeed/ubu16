https://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Network%20Share%20Via%20Samba%20Via%20CLI%20(Command-line%20interface/Linux%20Terminal)%20-%20Uncomplicated,%20Simple%20and%20Brief%20Way!


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install samba


Set a password for your user in Samba

    sudo smbpasswd -a <user_name>
    sudo smbpasswd -a chief

sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.org

Edit the file "/etc/samba/smb.conf"

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

    Once "smb.conf" has loaded, add this to the very end of the file:

    [<folder_name>]
    path = /home/<user_name>/<folder_name>
    valid users = <user_name>
    read only = no
*******************************************    
      [vshare]
    path = /srv/smba/vshare
    valid users = chief
    read only = no
********************************************
    Tip: There Should be in the spaces between the lines, and note que also there should be a single space both before and after each of the equal signs.

Restart the samba:

sudo service smbd restart

Once Samba has restarted, use this command to check your smb.conf for any syntax errors

testparm

To access your network share

      sudo apt-get install smbclient
      # List all shares:
      smbclient -L //<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name> -U <user>
      # connect:
      smbclient //<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name> -U <user>

To access your network share use your username (<user_name>) and password through the path "smb://<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name>/" (Linux users) or "\\<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>\<folder_name>\" (Windows users). Note that "<folder_name>" value is passed in "[<folder_name>]", in other words, the share name you entered in "/etc/samba/smb.conf".

    Note: The default user group of samba is "WORKGROUP".
